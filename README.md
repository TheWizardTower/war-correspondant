War Correspondant
===========

This runs a command, and sends telemetry for it up to either the console, or
to your Honeycomb account.

The name is from the folks who used to show up on TV from out-of-the way,
remote places, usually while said place was getting shelled into oblivion. The
sort of person who goes to dangerous, unpleasant places and sends back
information.
